                <h2>Fresh coffee </h2>
                <p>Ground coffee gets altered by oxygen, light, temperature, moisture, and many more factors. In as little as a few days, that can deteriorate the flavor of your daily drink. Grinding your own beans right before brewing will transform your
                    coffee!

                <h2>Customize your coffee</h2>
                <p>Looking for the perfect espresso? Aren't we all... A burr coffee grinder will allow you not only to achieve a <em>consistent</em> grind, but also fine-tune your grind size to what YOU like, improving your coffee and getting closer to that
                    perfect sip with every brew.</p>

                <i class="fas fa-chart-line fa-3x"></i>
                <h2>Full Potential </h2>
                <p>You have a great coffee machine, whether it is an espresso machine or any other brewing method. GREAT! However, do you feel bad putting store-bought, pre-ground coffee into it? Invest a fraction of your coffee machine's price into a burr
                    grinder to unlock its full potential!</p>

            <div id="reason3">
                <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd fa-3x"></i>
                <h2>Save money</h2>
                <p>Because whole coffee beans preserve for much longer, you will be able to purchase larger quantities of beans at once, for a fraction of the price, and much higher quality.</p>
